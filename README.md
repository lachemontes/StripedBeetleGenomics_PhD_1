**Comparative genomics and orthology analysis of the striped ambrosia beetle, *Trypodendron lineatum*: Functional, evolutionary, and ecological implications**  

---

## **Species Background**  🪲
- *Trypodendron lineatum* is a significant pest in Holarctic conifer forests.  
- Unlike bark beetles, it bores into xylem rather than phloem, primarily targeting stressed or dying conifers.  
- It farms a fungal mutualist, *Phialophoropsis ferruginea*, which aids in nutrient acquisition and counters tree defense mechanisms.  
- The beetle’s olfactory system is uniquely adapted for selecting host trees and maintaining fungal symbiosis.

## **Genomic Insights**  🧬
- *T. lineatum* has fewer chemoreceptors compared to other scolytine beetles.  
  - This reduction is due to fewer receptor lineage radiations and the absence of alternative splicing.  
  - Its streamlined chemosensory system reflects its ecological specialization.
